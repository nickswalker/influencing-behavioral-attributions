        <h1>Welcome</h1>
        <p>In this HIT you'll look at images showing a path that a robot could take to the door:</p>

        <gridworld-display id="player" terrain=
                "'XXXXXXX',
    'XR   GX',
    'X-----X',
    'X--F--X',
    'X-----X',
    'X0----X',
    'XXXXXXX'" trajectory="0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1"></gridworld-display>

        <p>We want to understand how people perceive and categorize these paths, so we'll ask you to organize them into groups. These groups should be based on which paths you think belong together. The interface for grouping will have a list of paths which you'll be able to drag into rows.</p>
        <p>After you're done making groups, we'll ask you to briefly explain why the items in each group belong together. We'll also ask your age and gender. Note that before we accept your work, we'll check that your explanations are plausible.</p>
        <p>The whole task should take 15 minutes. Please <b>complete this HIT only once</b>. Extra submissions will be rejected.</p>

        <p>The next pages describe this research and the data collected in more detail.</p>

        <h3>UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON<br />
            CONSENT FORM<br />
            ONLINE SURVEY - PERCEPTIONS OF A ROBOT</h3>

        <h3>Researchers' statement</h3>
        <p>We are asking you to be in a research study. The purpose of this consent form is to give you the information you will need to help you decide whether to be in the study or not. Please read the form carefully. You may ask questions about the purpose of the research, what we would ask you to do, the possible risks and benefits, your rights as a volunteer, and anything else about the research or this form that is not clear. When we have answered all your questions, you can decide if you want to be in the study or not. This process is called "informed consent."</p>

        <h3>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</h3>
        <p>This project aims to better understand how people perceive task-oriented robots. We are evaluating how different behaviors impact the perception of a robot.</p>

        <h3>STUDY PROCEDURES</h3>
        <p>In this study, you will be asked to watch clips and organize them into groups. After you have grouped them, you'll be asked to describe the groups. At the end, you will be asked to answer additional questions about the clips you saw. The study will take about 15 minutes total.</p>

        <h3>RISKS, STRESS, OR DISCOMFORT</h3>
        <p>This study does not present any risks that are greater than those of daily activities that involve using a personal computer or laptop. </p>
        <h3>BENEFITS OF THE STUDY</h3>
        <p>This research will inform the design of intelligent robots. You will not individually benefit from participation in the study.</p>

        <h3>SOURCE OF FUNDING</h3>
        <p>The study team and/or the University of Washington is receiving financial support from Honda Research Institute.</p>

        <h3>OTHER INFORMATION</h3>
        <p>You may refuse to participate and you are free to withdraw from this study at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled.</p>

        <h3>CONFIDENTIALITY OF RESEARCH INFORMATION</h3>
        <p>All of the information you provide will be confidential. There will be no association between your name and the answers you provide. The recordings will be analyzed by our research team to assess the effectiveness of the different behaviors used by the robot. Sample videos or snapshots from these recordings may be used in scientific articles or talks.</p>

        <h1>How to Use the Interface</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>The <b>top row shows all of the items you need to sort</b>. The other rows represent groups.</li>
            <li><b>Drag</b> each item into the group with the others you think it belongs with.</li>
            <li>You can add as many groups as you need. If you add more groups than you need, simply <b>leave the groups you don't need empty</b>.</li>
            <li>You can add as many items to a group as you need. The row will expand to hold them.</li>
